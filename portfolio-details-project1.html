                        Analysis of the dataset revealed the distribution of loan statuses: 82.96% were fully paid, 14.17% were charged off (defaulted), and 2.87% were current. This identified a significant class imbalance challenge that needed to be addressed in the modeling approach.

                        The analysis revealed that 43.33% of defaults occurred in the highest interest rate bracket (>20%), demonstrating a strong correlation between high interest rates and default risk. This insight became a key predictive factor in the model.
