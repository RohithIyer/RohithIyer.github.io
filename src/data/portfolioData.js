export const aboutMe = `Hi, I‚Äôm Rohith Krishnamurthy ‚Äî a data professional with a strong foundation in analytics, engineering, and business impact.

I recently completed my Master‚Äôs in Analytics from Northeastern University with a perfect 4.0 GPA. I‚Äôm currently working as a Data Engineer Intern at Vester, where I lead the development and quality assurance of robust data pipelines and evaluation frameworks for multiple AI models.

Before this, I spent 4+ years at Capgemini, where I advanced from Data Analyst to Senior Data Analyst, translating complex business requirements into data-driven solutions across finance, operations, and product domains.

Here are a few highlights from my journey:
	‚Ä¢	üìà Improved forecasting accuracy by 90% through ML-powered predictive models
	‚Ä¢	üìä Enhanced data accessibility by 15% via interactive dashboards
	‚Ä¢	‚öôÔ∏è Reduced data processing time by 40% by optimizing ETL workflows

My technical toolkit includes SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, TensorFlow, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure). What sets me apart is my ability to bridge technical execution with real business value.

As a graduate student, I not only deepened my expertise in machine learning and advanced analytics, but also balanced academics with part-time work as a Campus Security Proctor ‚Äî strengthening my time management and communication skills.

I actively engage in the tech community through events like Techstars Startup Weekend, and I recently completed a capstone project building a cryptocurrency investment assistant that combines deep learning, real-time data pipelines, and natural language interfaces for market analysis.

I‚Äôm now looking for full-time roles in predictive analytics, data strategy, or AI-driven decision systems, where I can help organizations turn data into measurable outcomes.

Let‚Äôs connect and build something impactful.`;
